##  Democritus
* first philosopher to put out the idea about atom.
* atom is the smallest possible particle present.
* Atom solved the zeno paradox.  According to zeno paradox , the finish line is never reached. Because everything can be divided into half. If infinity can also be divided into half then, there would be no finish line. But in reality , those lines can be crossed. So there must be a particle that could no longer be further divided.
