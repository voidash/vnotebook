## Weighted and Unweighted
## Directed and Undirected
## tree 
* undirected graph with no cycles

## DAG : directed acyclic graph
* directed graphs but without cycles
* used on git

## bipartite graph

* graph whose vertices can be split into two independent  group U,V such taht every edge connects between U and V.
